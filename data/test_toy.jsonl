This difference between laboratory-confirmed cases and clinically diagnosed influenza-like illness cases were likely due to an underdiagnosis of real cases caused by too few nasal swabs collected for laboratory confirmation. Zhang et al. conducted a case-control study and found that none of the passengers always wearing masks on the international flight were infected with H1N1 [32] , further suggesting that wearing masks properly may be protective when using public transport [40] . More importantly, protective benefits were also reported in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients [33] . Besides, Sokol's study also found a compliance, which showed a significant protective effect [29] . These findings implicated that proper use of masks has an impact on the effectiveness of preventing RVIs. Given that most people in household settings were unlikely to strictly follow hand hygiene and mask use recommendations [23], it is more critical to re-evaluate the strategy of self-quarantine or self-isolation at home during current COVID-19 outbreak due to higher risk of family cluster infection [45, 46] .", "query_id": "THUMSR-36", "paper_id": "ropgq7tr_11", "retrieval_score": 17.126307}

In addition, they had nasopharyngeal swabs scheduled on the first day of home isolation, which could have been day 1, 2, 4, or 5 after last exposure to patient, and a second swab scheduled on day 14 after their last exposure. The swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by using a PCR assay. None of the exposed health care workers developed symptoms, and all PCR tests were negative (Table) . Discussion: The primary route for the spread of COVID-19 is thought to be through aerosolized droplets that are expelled during coughing, sneezing, or breathing, but there also are concerns about possible airborne transmission. In the situation we describe, 85% of health care workers were exposed during an aerosol-generating procedure exposed while wearing a surgical mask, and the remainder were wearing N95 masks. That none of the health care workers in this situation acquired infection suggests that surgical masks, hand hygiene, and other standard procedures protected them from being infected. Our observation is consistent with previous studies that have been unable to show that N95 masks were superior to surgical masks for preventing influenza infection in health care workers (5) .", "query_id": "THUMSR-36", "paper_id": "xuv77kp6_0", "retrieval_score": 17.043457}

Although some clinicians have suggested the additional use of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)-given accounts of health-care workers acquiring SARS despite wearing N95 respirators, and available albeit limited evidence that PAPRs result in less contamination of health-care workers 43 -their use comes with significant logistical challenges. 93 There are several pitfalls related to PPE. Close attention to the supply chain is needed given the global shortage of medical masks and respirators. 5,6,94 Reuse between patients and use beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life might be required. 95 Fit testing-preferably done before outbreaks-is crucial and should be regularly performed as facial contours change with time. 96 Non-N95 reusable masks with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters that do not require fit testing might be considered.", "query_id": "THUMSR-36", "paper_id": "vsinwqnr_16", "retrieval_score": 17.043457}
